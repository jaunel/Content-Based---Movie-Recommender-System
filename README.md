# Content-Based---Movie-Recommender-System

Recommender System - Based upon some similarity we will get recommended. like youtube videos, e-commerce recommendation
There are three types of recommender system

    1. Content Based - Based upon the content we get recommended like similar songs recommended on GAANA.com while listening songs
    2. Collaborative filtering - Based upon similar personalities we get recommended. eg two person rated any movie quite similarly. so our algo will treat these two person similarly. And one user will get recommended based upon anothers watchlist.
    3. Hybrid based - Both technique is used jointly as per their convenience.
